					<h3>Why did you choose SAML2 / Shibboleth</h3>
				</span>
			</b>
			<br />
			When the Umbrella was built different Web Single Sign-On strategies have been evaluated: OpenID and SAML.
			<br />

			We found that full fledged comparisons between them already existed for similar scenarios:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a target="_blank" href="http://www.switch.ch/aai/support/faq/SWITCHaai_and_OpenID.html">http://www.switch.ch/aai/support/faq/SWITCHaai_and_OpenID.html</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a target="_blank" href="http://identitymeme.org/doc/draft-hodges-saml-openid-compare.html">http://identitymeme.org/doc/draft-hodges-saml-openid-compare.html</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
			OpenID is “typically internet”, which is good but not for this use case, as only HTTP connections are possible. Also no explicit
			conformance
			criteria is defined, which could lead to incompatibility. OpenID lacks a sophisticated trust model – the default trust model
			is to “trust
			all end everyone”. User privacy is not explicitly covered in the OpenID specification, which is a very important topic for
			our use case.
			As well as all security measures are optional (phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks).
			<br />
			<br />
			SAML does all of the above right and we found good reasons to stick with SAML. First of all it is free and open source. As a XML-based
			framework for communicating user authentication, entitlement and attribute information it is foreseen to be extended and custom tailored.
			SAML is state of the art and is designed by industry experts like EMC, Hewlett Packard, IBM, Microsoft, Nokia, Oracle, SAP, Boeing et.
			al. It considers user privacy a first-order priority which is crucial for the Umbrella use case. Used by national federations in the
			(higher) education sector it has shown and proved to work in a real-world environment. Federations across nation boundaries are being
			worked on. Nevertheless authentication is a dynamic field with ever changing technologies. Using such a standard allows to stay at the
			cutting edge with a minimum of development efforts.

					<h3>Why is there only one Identity Provider?</h3>
				</span>
			</b>
			<br />

			One reason for using a single IdP setup is the uniqueness of a person having multiple accounts at different facilities. Following an
			example:
			<br />

			<a href="/euu/layout/images/situation.png" rel="lightbox[whyoneidp]" title="Current Situation">
				<img src="/euu/layout/images/situation.png" width="300px" />
			</a>
			<br />
			In this picture you can find the situation of a multi IdP setup. It is reality that a large amount of users have accounts at different
			facilities. And there might be applications with an own user database disconnected from the facility user database. The single accounts
			are unique but:
			<ul>
				<li>Who can tell if the person behind peter.fischer@HZB is the same person as behind peter.fischer@ESRF?</li>
				<li>If you gathered data as peter.fischer@HZB how can you access these data as peter.fischer@esrf?</li>
				<li>Do you have to login with all the accounts simultaneously to access all data?</li>
			</ul>
			<br />

			<a href="/euu/layout/images/situation-federated.png" rel="lightbox[whyoneidp]" title="Situation with Multiple IdP">
				<img src="/euu/layout/images/situation-federated.png" width="300px" />
			</a>
			<br />
			This problem could be solved via account cross linking as the picture shows but the complexity (the number of connections between
			accounts is not linear but tends to be exponential. The advantage here is that the existing accounts could be reused for login.
			<br />

			<a href="/euu/layout/images/situation-umbrella.png" rel="lightbox[whyoneidp]" title="Umbrella Situation">
				<img src="/euu/layout/images/situation-umbrella.png" width="300px" />
			</a>
			<br />
			The Umbrella can be seen as a layer which brings together accounts (see picture above). Because every account just has to be connected to
			one
			other account the complexity here is linear. The disadvantage on this layer would firstly be that you have to create another account.
			But
			if you look closely at the multi IdP setup you can see that there is a need to connect the accounts and even more of them though you
			don't have to remember a new password.
