		Why the Free Electron Laser light is so special
	</h3>
	Radiation generated by an FEL is unique worldwide. Its special
	combination of features cannot be offered by any other light source:
	<ul>
		<li> Flashes are super bright. A single FEL pulse can reach some
			gigawatt of power within a short time &#8211; the same amount as
			several large power stations put together. Accordingly, compared to
			synchrotron radiation from storage rings or the light of common
			lasers flashes are more intense by magnitudes.
</li>
		<li> FELs, in contrast to normal lasers, can generate really
			short-wave radiation, meaning UV radiation or X-ray radiation. With
			the help of these short-wavelengths it is possible to have a much
			more detailed microscopic view of materials or biomolecules compared
			to visible light. X-ray radiation can even assist in identifying
			single atoms within a sample.
</li>
		<li> With FEL the wavelength of light, i.e. its colour, can be
			adjusted within a large range. This tuning across works only partly
			with common lasers. Depending on the respective material that takes
			on the light amplification, lasers radiate with a fixed colour.
</li>
		<li> FEL flashes are extremely short. They measure 10 to 50
			femtoseconds (thousand million millionths of a second) and are hence
			one thousand times shorter than synchrotron light pulses. This fact
			allows for analyses of extremely fast processes, e. g. chemical
			reactions.
</li>
		<li> At the same time the pulses are so intensive that a measurement
			is possible after one flash &#8211; an important prerequisite for
			example if microscopically small biological samples are to be
			analysed.
</li>
		<li> FEL pulses are strongly bundled. They can be focused on spots
			measured in micrometers which enable scientists to target minute
			samples of material.
</li>
		<li> In contrast to regular synchrotron radiation, FEL flashes are
			&#8220;coherent&#8221;: that is how the expert describes a typical
			feature of laser light; the single beams of radiation are stringently
			coordinated; whereas beams of a common lamp are completely
			independent of each other. Figuratively speaking, the single beams
			within a laser are marching in step &#8211; as a result, photos of
			holograms, i. e. high-resolution snapshots, become possible.
</li>
