<h1>IRUVX-PP  the preparatory phase of the EuroFEL consortium</h1>


<p>IRUVX-PP is the preparatory project to support the foundation of the EuroFEL Consortium. It is funded by the European Commission under the 7th Framework Programme for a period of three years, starting 1st April 2008. The EuroFEL Consortium is one of the 44 projects of the first European roadmap for new, large-scale Research Infrastructures, so-called ESFRI roadmap 2008 , and is a distributed Free Electron Laser (FEL) facility that joins complementary national FEL facilities into a unique European Research Infrastructure allowing novel and wide-ranging studies of matter by a large science community.
</p>
<p>IRUVX-PP partners are DESY and HZB (Germany), Elettra and INFN (Italy), Max-lab (Sweden), STFC (UK) and PSI (Switzerland). SOLEIL (France) and IPJ (Poland) are potential partners and participate as observers.
</p>
<p>Six work packages (WP1-6) take care of non-technical work including the development of a suitable organisational and governance structure of the future consortium. WP7 and WP8 carry out joint technical developments and associated training activities. The project greatly benefits from active exchange with other ESFRI roadmap projects which are dealing with similar issues, and a special EU legal framework for a European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC) that has become available in June 2009.
</p>
<p>Two annual meetings were held (2009 in Trieste and 2010 in DÃ¶llnsee near Berlin) where recent developments in the field were presented and the status and planning of the project were discussed.
</p>
<p>The meeting in 2009 was accompanied by two technical workshops, the one in 2010 was preceded by an industry workshop and a directors meeting on which the mission and core activities, the membership and the basic structure of the consortium were agreed.
