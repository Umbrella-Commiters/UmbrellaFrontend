		<p>In information technology, Federated Identity Management amounts to
			having a common set of policies, practices and protocols in place to
			manage the identity and trust into IT users and devices across
			organizations.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Related to federated identity is Single sign-on (SSO), where a
			user's authentication process is being used across multiple IT systems
			or even organizations. SSO is a subset of Federated Identity
			Management, as it relates only to authentication and is understood on
			the level of technical interoperability.</p>
		<br />
		<p>FIDM allows users to reuse electronic identities, saves
			administrators redundant work in maintaining user accounts and
			provides a consistent, trustworthy infrastructure component.</p>
		<br />

		<h3>Background</h3>

		<p>Centralized identity management solutions were created to help deal
			with user and data security where the user and the systems they
			accessed were within the same network – or at least the same "domain
			of control". Increasingly however, users are accessing external
			systems which are fundamentally outside of their domain of control,
			and external users are accessing internal systems. The increasingly
			common separation of user from the systems requiring access is an
			inevitable by-product of the decentralization brought about by the
			integration of the Internet into every aspect of both personal and
			business life. Evolving identity management challenges, and especially
			the challenges associated with cross-company, cross-domain issues, has
			given rise to a new approach of identity management, known now as
			"federated identity management".</p>
		<br />

		<h3>Federation Identity Management</h3>

		<p>FIDM, or the "federation" of identity, describes the technologies,
			standards and use-cases which serve to enable the portability of
			identity information across otherwise autonomous security domains. The
			ultimate goal of identity federation is to enable users of one domain
			to securely access data or systems of another domain seamlessly, and
			without the need for completely redundant user administration.
			Identity
			federation comes in many flavors, including "user-controlled"
			or
			"user-centric" scenarios, as well as enterprise controlled or B2B
			scenarios.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Federation is enabled through the use of open industry standards
			and/or openly
			published specifications, such that multiple parties can
			achieve
			interoperability for common use cases. Typical use-cases
			involve
			things
			such as cross-domain, web-based single sign-on,
			cross-domain user
			account provisioning, cross-domain entitlement
			management and
			cross-domain user attribute exchange.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Use of identity federation standards can reduce cost by eliminating
			the
			need to scale one-off or proprietary solutions. It can increase
			security and lower risk by enabling an organization to identify and
			authenticate a user once, and then use that identity information
			across
			multiple systems, including external partner websites. It can
			improve
			privacy compliance by allowing the user to control what
			information is
			shared, or by limiting the amount of information shared.
			And lastly,
			it
			can drastically improve the end-user experience by
			eliminating the need
			for new account registration through automatic
			"federated
			provisioning"
			or the need to redundantly login through
			cross-domain single sign-on.
			The notion of identity federation is
			extremely broad, and also
			evolving. It could involve user-to-user,
			user-to-application as well
			as
			application-to-application use-case
			scenarios at both the browser tier
			as well as the web services or
			service-oriented architecture (SOA)
			tier. It can involve high-trust,
			high-security scenarios as well as
			low-trust, low security scenarios.
			The levels of identity assurance
			that may be required for a given
			scenario are also being standardized
			through a common and open Identity
			Assurance Framework. It can involve
			user-centric use-cases, as well as
			enterprise-centric use-cases. The
			term "identity federation" is by
			design a generic term, and is not
			bound to any one specific protocol,
			technology, implementation or
			company.</p>
		<br />
		<p>One thing that is consistent, however, is the fact that "federation"
			does
			describe methods of identity portability which are achieved in an
			open,
			often standards-based manner – meaning anyone adhering to the
			open
			specification or standard can achieve the full spectrum of
			use-cases
			and interoperability.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Identity federation can be accomplished any number of ways, some of
			which
			involve the use of formal Internet standards, such as the OASIS
			Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) specification, and some of
			which may involve open source technologies and/or other openly
			published specifications (e.g. Information Cards, OpenID, the Higgins
			trust framework or Novell’s Bandit project).</p>
