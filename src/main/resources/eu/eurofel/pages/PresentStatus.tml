	<p>As soon as Umbrella is installed and federated identity management is available, many trans-facility services are possible, which at present are still under development. The concept of the Umbrella project is not to deliver a closed box but rather this loosely coupled bundle of tools with a new component published as soon as it is ready. This concept also allows components to be defined in a flexible way in collaboration with the final users and according to the available resources. Instead of waiting until all functionalities are available, it has was decided to offer them to the users at the moment they are ready and provide a road map for the further developments.</p> 
	<br/>
	<p>Umbrella interacts closely with the local WUO systems at the individual facilities and the implementation / deployment follows a conservative procedure, in order to keep problems at a minimum. From the over a dozen facilities three have volunteered to participate in the first-wave (ESRF, ILL, PSI) implementation. The other facilities will follow in fall 2013.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>The implementation of the first-wave facilities occurs in four phases:</p>
	<br/>
	<p><b>Phase 0 (technical):</b> the three partner facilities make their WUO system Umbrella-ready. The systems are technically ready. This phase has been completed beginning of June 2013.</p>
	<br/>
	<p><b>Phase I (experts):</b> the three first-wave partner facilities allow access to their WUO experts. This allows for basic technical tests of the system (consistency, completeness). This phase goes till end of June 2013.</p>
	<br/>
	<p><b>Phase II (friendly users):</b>  Access to Umbrella is allowed for a few hands full of selected users. They are asked to test the system from the normal facility user perspective and to feedback their experience. Foreseen till Mid July 2013.</p>
	<br/>
	<p><b>Phase III:</b> Access is open to all users (Foreseen from Mid July 2013).</p>
	<br/>
	<p>Initially, these implementation phases cover only the basic functionalities of Umbrella (Login, personal information update, access to the local user office systems). During the whole process direct feedback by the users is extremely important as only in this way it will be possible to develop a system which complies with the real needs of the users.</p>
