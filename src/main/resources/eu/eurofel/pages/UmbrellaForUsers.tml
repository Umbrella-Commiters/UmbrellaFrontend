<p>Umbrella is a <i>federated identity system</i> for the users of the (European) large neutron and photon facilities.</p>
<br/>
<p><i>Identity system</i>: Umbrella allows providing these users with a unique, <i>persistent</i> identity. That means that a user will be able to log in at any of the participating facilities and have access to the services offered. There will be only one person with this identity.</p>
<br/>
<p><i>Persistent</i>: Once defined, this identity will be valid for the rest of the academic life.</p>
<br/>
<p><i>Federated</i>: This identity is valid not only at one facility but holds at all partner facilities.</p>
