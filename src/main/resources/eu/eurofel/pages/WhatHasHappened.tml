	<p>Research at the European large photon and neutron facilities has been very successful as impressively demonstrated by the large number of high-profile publications and several Nobel prizes. However, there are developments within the experimental environment (e.g. novel detectors, need for remote experiment access, need for remote data access, access to new analysis techniques and tools) which call for an adaption of the experimental infrastructure. These requirements are quite similar for all facilities, thus a common approach appears to be highly advantageous. Giving the international user community access to these new developments requires a federated identity management on a higher and trans-facility level (i.e. at the moment European maybe later international).</p>
	<br/>
	<p>As a reaction, the Umbrella project has been started as part of WP2 (work package 2) of the IRUVX-PP ESFRI (future EuroFEL; Free Electron Lasers of Europe) project.  Soon it became clear that this need was going beyond the FEL user community and should be extended to the Photon and Neutron community at large, as the needs are very similar. Within WP2 of IRUVX-PP, functionality and architecture of Umbrella have been formulated and a prototype version has been produced. After that, work on Umbrella is being continued as part of the PaNdata ODI (WP3) and CRISP (WP16) EU FP7 programs. The development and implementation of Umbrella is carried through in close collaboration with other  FP7 programs such as:  CALIPSO (synchrotron facilities) and NMI3 (neutron facilities). In this way all European large facilities are represented as active partners or observers of the Umbrella project, thus covering with Umbrella as federated-identity system the whole photon / neutron large facility community with more than 30.000 users.</p>
